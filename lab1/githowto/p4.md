now, we can simulate some works process. lets change our file 1.txt

echo " some changes" >> 1.txt

and now we run git status
we will see that it detected our changes, so we have to add and commit them now:
git add 1.txt
git commit -m "added changes to the 1.txt"

however, if you dont want these changes, do git checkout (to get previous lates version that has no changes)
