we can also create version tags:
git tag v1
thus, current file versions will have v1 tag
so, now we can switch to that version
git checkout v1

if we need slightly older version than v1
git checkout v1^
^ in this case shows that we need commit, that is one commit behind v1. we can use ~1 instead of ^

we can also see all tags available:
git tag
