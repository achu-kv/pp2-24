git - version control system that allows rollbacks in case of some problems in codebase, or just if you want to

git repo(sitory) - essentially a folder with code itself and hidden folder .git, that saves all changes and states

commit - piece of history of the git repo, that is based on some previous commit. And so, git repo history built using chain of commits

branch - ...branch of your repository, that is parallel to some other branch and does not break anything there
